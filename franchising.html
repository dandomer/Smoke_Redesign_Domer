      <h1><a id="faq"><b>FAQ</b></a></h1>

        <h3>Q: How much is the Franchise Fee and do you ever negotiate on the franchise fee?</h3>
        <p>A: The franchise fee for the first restaurant is $30,000. If a candidate is awarded additional stores the franchise fee is reduced to $25,000 for each additional store under the same ownership.</p>
        
        <h3>Q: Does Smoke offer financing?</h3>
        <p>A: No, we do not offer financing at this time.</p>
        
        <h3>Q: What is the average sales volume of a Smoke restaurant?</h3>
        <p>A: Due to Federal Trade Commission restrictions and various state regulations, we are not permitted to provide you with specific sales and profit projections. During the applications process you will receive a Franchise Disclosure Document that contains a list of current franchisees. You are welcome to call them to discuss their experiences.</p>
        
        <h3>Q: How much is the royalty fee and how is it collected?</h3>
        <p>A: The royalty fee is 5% of gross sales and is automatically withdrawn on a weekly basis.</p>

        <h3>Q: Is there an advertising/marketing fund?</h3>
        <p>A: Currently, there is not a national advertising fund although the agreement allows for an advertising fund to be established of up to 2% of gross sales.

This expenditure is not paid to the franchisor but an accounting of the expenditure is submitted quarterly.</p>

        <h3>Q: How long does it take to open my restaurant?</h3>
